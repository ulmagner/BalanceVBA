# BalanceVBA
Balance formating

Write a macro that checks the number of times each client appears in the list, then turns the table's entire row red if they appear more than 3 times and they are Standard status, 5 times if they are VIP, and 10 times if they are Golden.

Only count an occurence if:
- their balance at the time was < 0 and they are Standard;
- their balance was < -100 and they are VIP;
- their balance was < -500 and they are Golden.
